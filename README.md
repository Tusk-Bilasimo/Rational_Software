# Rational Software Repository

> _"You don't need the complex numbers. The rationals are enough, if you are brave enough to listen."_  
> — Inspired by Norman J. Wildberger and the Prime Wave Theory journey

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a **centralized reference point** for software, scripts, and documents related to **rational approaches to mathematical analysis**, particularly those exploring:

-   **Rational alternatives** to complex-number-based methods
    
-   **Prime number analysis** using additive and rational trigonometric principles
    
-   **Computational implementations** of concepts from the blog post _"From Imaginary Primes to Rational Resonance: A Nine-Year Journey"_
    

## 🧭 Purpose

This collection is intentionally **eclectic and exploratory**. Files here may or may not be directly related to each other, but they all connect to the overarching theme of finding **rational, arithmetic-based explanations** for phenomena traditionally approached with complex analysis, transcendental functions, or wave-based models.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### **Rational Resonance**

The insight that many mathematical patterns—especially prime distributions—can be understood through **purely rational operations** (addition, multiplication, differences) without resorting to complex numbers or transcendental functions.

### **Prime Quadrance**

Applying Wildberger's concept of _quadrance_ (distance squared) to prime factor sums, creating a stable, rational metric that reveals structural patterns in the integers.

### **From ℂ to ℚ**

The philosophical shift from seeking explanations in the complex plane to finding them in the rational relationships inherent in natural numbers themselves.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Browse the folders** to find implementations relevant to your interests
    
2.  **Check file headers** for context about each script's purpose
    
3.  **Experiment** with modifying parameters to observe rational patterns
